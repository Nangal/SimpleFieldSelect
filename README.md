# Qlik Sense extension for field and variable selections with "missing features"

This extension is an "all in one" selection component with several customization options. It gives Qlik Sense many Qlikview features like select only one, default value and context menu.
To reduce amount of required extensions on a sheet Simple Field Select has global options for the current sheet modification. In this way you can hide many settings for example inside the year selector. In addition you can set  background color of the sheet, hide title bar, modify all borders, remove Insights button etc.

If you have a good idea for further development, let us know.

## To install
Download a ZIP file from the dist directory or clone the branch. Install the zip as any Qlik Sense extension.

## Latest features
- Option to clear selections of the field on sheet leave / enter
- Add text object to menu bar
- Global option to **clear all** selections when arriving to sheet and when leaving a sheet. Finally a good implementation to clear selection on sheet arrival. Works well in combination with default value selection. This was a customer requested feature.
  - Enable Global modifications for only one SimpleFieldSelect object per sheet.
- Qlik Sense November's native feature for Always one selected doesn't allow selection through API as before.
- Option to select many values into one variable
- Select defaults only once
- Show only selected
- Main object width parameter
- Note! Change to export mode handling in 1.8.6, see release notes
- Responsive font size options
- Menu icon styled right click menu trigger - if export mode is used, right click menu won't work
- Gloabl options for hiding Smart search, Selections tool and new Insights buttons from the toolbar


## Features
- supports **select only one** and **default value(s)** selection - so when you enter to a document or a sheet, you can have default value/values selected
  - If you use default values with variables, it's best to set the default value to the variable in the beginning. 
  - Default values can be selected only once.
- has a context menu (right click menu) for _select all_, _clear selections_, _reverse selection_, _select possible_, _select default values_ and _select randomly_ (Just came to my mind, for fun maybe). You can select which options are shown on the menu.
- will fit on one line - you can disable Qlik Sense default header, paddings, margins and do other tricks to enhance standard visualization
- renders as a list, button row, checkbox, standard radio button or drop down selector.
- for variable control there is now almost every HTML5 standard input
  - for example slider
- custom text fields: label text, tooltip for mouse hovering and help text below the element
- can set variable value from predefined list or via **date picker**
  - two variables can be set at the same selection (if you need a value for UI and value for other usage)
  - date picker can limit to min and max date
- mobile zoom effect can be disabled. No need for three clicks if you want to select something. **Only one click is enough!!**
- several posibilities for visual changes like colors, borders etc. Custom CSS classes, HTML attributes can be applied to rendering. In this way you can use for example CSS classes from other libraries to render elements.
- supports hiding a field from Qlik Sense's selection row
- supports transparency of the object
- Some of the visualizations allow to use Qlik Sense's Leonard UI styling, for example for drop down select Leonard UI styling works well
- search can be enabled for some of the visualizations
- several color settings like background color for the object itself
- Hide all headers from a sheet + color options for every header
- Qlik Sense styled switch and checkbox
- Dropdown can be now used as multiselect. Naturally doesn't work with variables
- Select2 plugin has been integrated to the extension. It allows to use a searchable dropdown menu, either normal version or multiselect version.
- custom HTML pre/post every element
- Option to clear selection on sheet enter or leave.

## Global sheet level settings
All following global settings are sheet specific. You can use for example master items if you wan't to have the same settings on same element on every sheet.

- Global parameters for a sheet:
  - Modify background color of the sheet and all objects.
  - Change border style for all objects on the sheet.
  - Hide any field(s) from the selection bar.
  - Hide sheet title or modify it's size and font-size
  - Hide selections bar and main menu bar. But be carefull if you remove the main menu, you can access edit mode only by changing the end of the url to /state/edit
  - Hide header from the Text & Image objects. You will get much more space for the text itself! Many times users cannot see the text because of the size of the header in the text object so now you can get rid of it!
  - Hide header from every object on a sheet
  - Reduce header padding in all objects while using Focus theme
  - Font-family and font color can be set for all elements
  - Remove filter boxes from Pivot tables
  - Extra text field to selection bar and header
  - Hide pivot table filter boxes for extra space
  - Hide Smart search, Selections tool and Insights buttons
  - Clear all selections when arriving to sheet and when leaving a sheet

This extension is supposed to be very light weight. It has no big libraries attached to it. In this way your Qlik Sense application is able to stay as fast as possible.
** Note: To allow extent modification possibilities in this extension some text fields allow Qlik developer to write Javascript, HTML and CSS and this might cause issues if user written code is broken or does unwanted things. **
